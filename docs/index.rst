It's increasingly common for software and projects to have documentation sites with auto-generated docs and/or examples using Jupyter notebooks. Some examples include:

* `geopanda documentation and examples <https://geopandas.org/en/stable/>`_
* `osmnx documentation <https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/osmnx.html>`_

Some `CyberGIS Center <https://cybergis.illinois.edu/>`_ projects with sites include:

* `cybergisx-cli <https://cybergis.github.io/cybergisx-cli/>`_ (made with `MkDocs <https://www.mkdocs.org/>`_)
* `cybergis-compute-python-sdk <https://cybergis.github.io/cybergis-compute-python-sdk/>`_ (made with `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_)

This site has the goal of walking through how to create one of these sites with Sphinx. At the end of the tutorial, you could end up with the `Examples page <examples.html>`_ and `User Reference page <reference.html>`_.
